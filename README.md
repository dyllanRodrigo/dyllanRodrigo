👋 Hi my name is Dyllan, a developer and Systems Engineering student with knowledge in software development.

A good performance in science and mathematics made me compete in national (ONC) and international (OMCC) competitions in my student life, obtaining important recognitions. But, the most valuable thing about the Olympics has been expressing logical and critical thinking when solving problems, which is important when developing software and computer systems. Some of the programming languages ​​that I have used the most are: Python, Java, C#, C++ and JavaScript.

Aside from programming I always desire to learn new and interesting things. That's why I am part of the maker culture, which makes me want to develop or invent my own things. Among them, over time I have developed things like two 2D video games, both released for Android devices in Google Play Store, my own RepRap 3D printer, a stereo HIFI system powered by my own amplifier which uses an Arduino as a controller for example.

The desire to innovate and see my ideas come true means that I always have some good DIY projects to cook!🏗️

### ⚡ Fun facts
- I am very close to closing my career plan
- I was a finalist in the national Olympics in the area of mathematics for three consecutive years, obtaining 2 silver medals and one bronze in 2013-2015.
- I represented Guatemala in the Central American Mathematics Olympiad in 2016 in Kingston Jamaica.
- I participated in the math competition organized by Burger King in 2015 and won first place, which earned me a ticket redeemable for a family burger combo.
- My first mobile application was a 2D video game developed in Unity using C# when I was 15, which was uploaded to the Play Store and since I added Google ads, it generated the funny amount of $1.20 😂 but I learned a lot, which made it special.
- The first 3D printer I built along with a team of friends was sold to an advertising company in 2017 and we called it "Talent 3D".
- In 2019 my apps were removed from Google Play for not updating the recent APIs, but I keep the APK projects and installers :)
- I enjoy music a lot, that's why one of my favorite hobbies is HiFi audio. Yes, I have a part of me that is a music lover but also an audiophile.

### 🛠️ Hobbies I’m interested in
- 💻 Programming (especially discovering AI tech and machine learning)
- 🔊 HiFi Audio / PA audio tuning
- 🔧 3D printing
- 🌱 Exotic carnivorous plants
- 🪼 Aquarism
- 🏋🏽 Weightlifting (the gym in general, helps me release stress and improve my health)
